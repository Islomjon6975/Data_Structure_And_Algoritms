// #1 Which one is "better" implementation?

// "Better" means faster time to finish and to use less memory (RAM),
// altough there is a much stronger emphasis on the former.

// Readablity of the code does NOT factor at all. Performance is King!


// #2 Why not hard time measurements?

// Computers differ widely in their processors, so you will often get
// different times for each computer, hard to standardize!

// Manually testing the time of your code with each new implementation is not practical

// what if there was a way to quickly measure the performance of your code by just
// looking at it, rather than manually timing it ?
